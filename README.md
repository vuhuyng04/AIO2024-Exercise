# AIO2024-Exercise


## Note
The repository includes **Modules 1-5** from the original project, which were developed under the old account. Moving forward, I will continue the development and future updates of this project on this new account.

This repository contains the source code for the **AIO2024-Exercise** project. The code was originally created by **vuhuyng** on an older GitHub account. Unfortunately, I lost access to that account due to the loss of the device used for **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**, which made it impossible to log in. As a result, I have re-uploaded the project here on my new GitHub account **vuhuyng04**.

This project was originally published under the account [vuhuyng](https://github.com/vuhuyng), and I am the original author. Due to the loss of access to my previous account, this repository has been re-uploaded to my new account **vuhuyng04**. Future development and updates will continue here.
